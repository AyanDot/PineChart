This takes hours or days per indicator, requires MQL5 expertise, and you have to redo the work every time the original Pine Script changes. PineChart eliminates all of that: drop in your Pine Script source file and it runs as-is. The built-in interpreter faithfully reproduces Pine Script's per-bar execution model, NA propagation, series reverse-access semantics, and 511+ implemented Pine API functions/features. You also get a modern TradingView-style charting UI for free."

          <p>Three simple steps to run any Pine Script indicator in MT5. No coding, no MQL5 knowledge needed.</p>
        </header>

        <div class="steps-list">
          <!-- Step 1 -->

            <div class="step-content">
              <div class="step-number">1</div>
              <h3>Copy Your Favourite Indicator or Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                Find the Pine Script indicator or strategy you want to use on TradingView. Copy the full source code
                into a
                <code>.txt</code> file. PineChart's interpreter supports Pine Script v5/v6 syntax — if/else, for/while
                loops, var/varip,
                user-defined functions and types, and 511+ implemented Pine API functions/features. You can run any Pine Script indicator in
                MT5
                that uses supported API calls.

              <h3>Paste It Into the MT5 Files Directory</h3>
              <p>
                Save the <code>.txt</code> file into MetaTrader 5's <strong>MQL5/Files/</strong> folder. This is where
                PineChart looks
                for Pine Script source files at startup. You can add as many scripts as you like — PineChart supports
                running multiple
                Pine Script indicators simultaneously inside MT5, each with isolated execution state. Every Pine Script
                indicator in MT5 runs in its own execution context.

                Attach PineChart to any chart and type the filename(s) in the <strong>InpIndicators</strong> input field
                (comma-separated for multiple). PineChart's lexer tokenizes, parser builds the AST, and the interpreter
                executes every bar — just like TradingView. Your Pine Script indicator is now running live in MetaTrader
                5.

          <p>
            TradingView is a web-based charting platform where Pine Script runs natively — but it's a separate ecosystem
            from your broker's trading terminal.
            MetaTrader 5 is the standalone trading terminal used by the majority of forex and CFD brokers worldwide and
            does not support Pine Script out of the box.
            This means traders who want to use their favourite Pine Script indicators for live trading in MT5 have
            traditionally had to manually rewrite every script in MQL5 — a completely different language.
            PineChart bridges that gap by providing a full Pine Script interpreter that runs directly inside MetaTrader
            5, so you can use the same indicator source code on both platforms.
            There's no need to maintain two separate codebases or switch between platforms.
            If you want to run Pine Script in MetaTrader 5 without learning MQL5, PineChart is the solution.

                Yes. PineChart is an MQL5 Expert Advisor that runs Pine Script indicators directly inside MetaTrader 5.
                You paste your Pine Script source file into the MT5 Files directory, type the filename in the EA input,
                and PineChart's built-in interpreter executes the script on every bar — no manual conversion to MQL5 is
                needed. It currently supports 511 out of 768 Pine Script functions (approximately 66% of the full API),
                including moving averages, oscillators, drawing objects, and more.

                No. PineChart includes a full Pine Script interpreter built entirely in MQL5. It has its own lexer,
                parser, and per-bar execution engine that reads your .txt Pine Script files at runtime. You never touch
                MQL5 code. Just place your Pine Script source file in the MT5 Files directory, specify the filename in
                the EA settings, and PineChart handles the rest — tokenizing, parsing the AST, and executing each bar
                with the correct Pine Script semantics.

                Manual porting means rewriting every Pine Script line in MQL5 — a different language with different data
                models, no series semantics, and no built-in TA library. This takes hours or days per indicator,
                requires MQL5 expertise, and you have to redo the work every time the original Pine Script changes.
                PineChart eliminates all of that: drop in your Pine Script source file and it runs as-is. The built-in
                interpreter faithfully reproduces Pine Script's per-bar execution model, NA propagation, series
                reverse-access semantics, and 511+ implemented Pine API functions/features. You also get a modern TradingView-style charting
                UI for free.

                Yes. PineChart supports multi-indicator mode via a comma-separated list in the InpIndicators input. Each
                indicator gets its own isolated execution context (PineContext, UDT pool, table pool, cached AST) while
                sharing bar data, the PlotManager, DrawingStore, and SecurityDataPool. You can also run one optional
                strategy alongside your indicators using the InpStrategy input.

                PineChart runs as a standard MQL5 Expert Advisor, so it works with any MetaTrader 5 broker. There are no
                special server-side requirements. As long as your broker provides a standard MT5 terminal, PineChart
                will run. For strategy execution and live trading, order compatibility depends on your broker's
                supported filling modes and order types, but the core Pine Script indicator functionality works
                universally.

                If your Pine Script calls a function that PineChart hasn't implemented yet, the interpreter will log a
                message in the Experts tab identifying the unsupported function. Unsupported functions typically return
                na (not available) or 0, depending on context, so the rest of your script continues to execute. The API
                is actively being expanded — currently at 66% coverage (511 of 768 functions) with regular updates
                adding new namespaces and built-ins.

                PineChart is not TradingView and is not affiliated with TradingView. It is an independent MQL5 Expert
                Advisor that provides two things: (1) a Pine Script interpreter that can execute Pine v5/v6 source code
                inside MetaTrader 5, and (2) a modern, TradingView-style charting interface with smooth, lag-free rendering.
                It does not connect to TradingView's servers or use TradingView's data. All market data comes from your
                MT5 broker. Think of PineChart as bringing Pine Script compatibility and a modern charting UI to the MT5
                ecosystem.
